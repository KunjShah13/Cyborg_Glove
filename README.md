# Cyborg_Maker 
## team_42 submission to Dotslash 5.0

A glove which enhances the ability of a maker to measure certain parameters on-the-go.  
And a mouse which eliminates the need of an external mouse, and can navigate with the finger while coding.

The parameters which can be measured are:  
  =>  Electrical Measurements  
    1. Voltmeter  
    2. Ohmmeter  
    3. Ammeter  
    4. Capacitance meter  
  =>  Mechanical Measurements  
    5. Distance  
    6. RPM of a shaft  
    7. Angle measurement/ Spirit Leveller  
    8. Temperature and Humidity Measurement
